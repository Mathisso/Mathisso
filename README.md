### üö¥ My Journey

Since my beginnings with the basics of HTML and CSS, I embarked on a journey to understand the fundamentals of web development. I progressed through each stage, mastering advanced styling with Sass and Bootstrap, writing dynamic scripts with PHP, and efficiently managing data with MySQL. Each new skill acquired has enriched my developer toolkit.

I am particularly excited about exploring JavaScript and enhancing user experience with Vue.js, as well as strengthening my backend skills with Symfony. My journey also includes learning programming languages such as C, C++, C#, and Python, along with modern tools like Linux, npm, Git, and Visual Studio Code. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another exciting dimension that I am beginning to explore.

I am committed to continuous improvement and invite you to follow my projects, insights, and progress throughout this enriching journey.
